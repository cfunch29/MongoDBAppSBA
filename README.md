# MongoDB SBA Application 

## Beverage Menu
I used to bartend and wanted to do something streamlined that coincided with that. This application can easily be expanded by adding prices or categories or calories etc. But for the purpose of this SBA we will have a collection of drinks: wines, mocktails and soft drinks.

### Reflection

`What could you have done differently during the planning stages of your project to make the execution easier?`

`Were there any requirements that were difficult to implement? What do you think would make them easier to implement in future projects?`

`What would you add to or change about your website if given more time?`
