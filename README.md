# MongoDB SBA Application 

## Beverage Menu
I used to bartend and wanted to do something streamlined that coincided with that. I feel like this application can easily be expanded by adding prices or categories or calories etc. But for the purpose of this SBA we will have a collection of drinks: wines, mocktails and soft drinks.
