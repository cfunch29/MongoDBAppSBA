# MongoDB SBA Application 

## Beverage Menu
I used to bartend and wanted to do something streamlined that coincided with that. This application can easily be expanded by adding prices or categories or calories etc. But for the purpose of this SBA we will have a collection of drinks: wines, mocktails and soft drinks.

### Reflection 
---
`What could you have done differently during the planning stages of your project to make the execution easier?`
Starting at base level then adding more complicated features like models and schemas. 

`Were there any requirements that were difficult to implement? What do you think would make them easier to implement in future projects?`

I tried to use models and schemas but I couldn't get my routes connected. I can't figure out where I'm missing my code. I tried console logging to keep track of where I'm losing the route. 

`What would you add to or change about your website if given more time?`
I would make a better MVP. I want to know that my code is at least doing minimum function.
